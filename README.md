# XAI + RAG Guardrail

## Problem
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate rich and helpful answers, but they also risk producing **toxic outputs** or falling victim to **prompt injection attacks**. To increase **trust and safety**, this project combines three components:
1. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Retrieve factual knowledge from a text corpus.  
2. **Guardrail:** Detect and block unsafe or toxic outputs.  
3. **XAI (Explainable AI):** Provide transparent explanations for guardrail decisions.  

---

## Architecture
The pipeline works as follows:  
A user query is embedded into a vector space, and **RAG** retrieves relevant text passages from a knowledge base. The query and retrieved context are passed to an **LLM**, which generates an answer. That answer is checked by a **guardrail module** for toxicity and unsafe patterns. If flagged, an **XAI module** explains which words or features contributed most to the decision.  
This design ensures not only safer outputs but also transparency about why a decision was made.  

---

## MVP Goals
- Build a minimal RAG pipeline (FAISS + Sentence Transformers).  
- Connect an LLM to generate context-grounded answers.  
- Add a guardrail for toxicity detection and blocking unsafe responses.  
- Integrate an XAI method (e.g., Integrated Gradients) to explain guardrail decisions.  
- Provide README documentation and 10–20 test queries with sample outputs.  

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Retrieval (RAG):** For 15 test queries, at least one relevant passage is retrieved in the top-3 (**Hit@3 ≥ 80%**).  
- **Guardrail:** On 20 test cases (10 safe, 10 toxic), toxic detection precision is **≥ 0.8**.  
- **XAI:** For at least 90% of blocked cases, 3 or more meaningful tokens are highlighted as decision drivers.  
- **Documentation:** README includes problem statement, architecture, evaluation results, and XAI visualizations.

## Future Work
This project is designed as a foundation for further research. Potential extensions include:  

- **Advanced Guardrails:** Explore adversarial attacks (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreak attempts) and measure robustness.  
- **Cross-Lingual Bias Analysis:** Evaluate performance of toxicity detection and explanations across multiple languages (English, Persian, etc.).  
- **XAI Method Comparison:** Compare Integrated Gradients, LIME, SHAP, and attention-based explanations to assess interpretability.  
- **Safety–Utility Trade-off:** Systematically evaluate how stricter guardrails affect both safety and the usefulness of generated answers.  
- **Human Evaluation:** Conduct user studies to measure how understandable and actionable the XAI explanations are.  
- **Scalability:** Extend the RAG corpus to larger datasets and measure performance in real-world workloads.
